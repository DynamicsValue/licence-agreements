License FAQ
=====================================

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding our licenses.

Disclaimer: this section does not represent legal advice. Always consult with your legal team.


**Why have you changed the license?**

Short answer: sustainability. The demand of users of FakeXrmEasy has grown well over capacity and it can't just be managed as a community side-project anymore. Therefore, we're changing the license so that we can continue to deliver always up-to-date amazing software for businesses while also making it free of charge for true community projects and/or non-commercial purposes. [For the full long answer about how we got here, please read this post.](https://dynamicsvalue.com/v2/why) 

**What license does FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later use?**

FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later uses a triple licensed model. You can choose to use the software under the OSI approved [Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL 1.5)](https://github.com/DynamicsValue/licence-agreements/blob/main/FakeXrmEasy/RPL_1_5.md), a Modified Polyform Non-commercial 1.0.0 license, or a commercial license. [See the license for more details](https://github.com/DynamicsValue/licence-agreements/blob/main/FakeXrmEasy/LICENSE.md).

**Can I use the new version free of charge?**

You can use FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later free of charge if you meet the requirements of either the [RPL 1.5](https://github.com/DynamicsValue/licence-agreements/blob/main/FakeXrmEasy/RPL_1_5.md) or the [Modified Polyform Non-commercial license](https://github.com/DynamicsValue/licence-agreements/blob/main/FakeXrmEasy/LICENSE.md). 

**Can I use FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later for my personal project?**

Yes, both the RPL 1.5 and the Modified Polyform Non-commercial license 1.0.0 cover personal use.

**What are the main requirements of the Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL 1.5)?**

Under the RPL 1.5, any piece of code where FakeXrmEasy is used must be made available to the community, as well as displaying a User-Visible Attribution Notice according to section 6.4 d) of the RPL 1.5. 

The RPL 1.5 encourages a sustainable open source model where you can either "pay in code" or else buy a commercial license for privacy. Either way, the community benefits via new contributions or via supporting a model that sustains and produces more open source. Please [read the full RPL 1.5 license](https://github.com/DynamicsValue/licence-agreements/blob/main/FakeXrmEasy/RPL_1_5.md) for more details.

**What are the main differences between the Modified Polyform Non-commercial license 1.0.0 and the original Polyform Non-Commercial 1.0.0 license?**

The Modified Polyform Non-commercial license includes an exception to allow commercial use if your organisation is an environmental protection agency or a health care organisation whose participation is 100% public. 

Health care organisations or Environmental Protection Agencies with any kind of private ownership who don't meet the requirements of RPL 1.5 and want to use FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later should buy a commercial license. 

We believe these are fundamental services that should be covered even under in a commercial context as their primary goal is to either protect our environment or provide free health care services.

**How many Commercial licenses do I need and what does a 'user' mean?**

A user means a person who is directly using FakeXrmEasy software version 2 or later. Licenses are granted per person and can not be shared. As a rule of thumb - anyone that writes or needs to debug code that uses FakeXrmEasy should be covered by a commercial license.

If you offer FakeXrmEasy as a service internally, (for example by exposing its functionality via an API), your company must subscribe for a subscription covering the number of internal users (developers) of that service since these are also your users. 

If you offer your own framework or extensions on top of FakeXrmEasy, users of such framework or extensions will also need a valid license.

**I love FakeXrmEasy, but how can I justify the investment decision to my managers?**

We've conducted a pretty extensive research study with the help of developers from more than 30 different organisations who were already using FakeXrmEasy v1. The outcome was 33% increased development efficiency and 191% increased efficiency due to reduced escaped defects that didn't make it to production or other environments. [Feel free to download the study here at this link](http://insert-link-here).

If you still have questions, we'd be more than happy to answer those. Please do reach out to us via sales@dynamicsvalue.com.

**Do I need to pay for additional seats for my build or release pipelines / agents / servers ?**

No. The license covers unlimited build agents or release pipelines as long as every developer who is pushing changes through these pipelines has a valid FakeXrmEasy license.

**I'm a Contractor, can I use my license for my customer projects?**

FakeXrmEasy licenses are issued to the company that directs the developers using FakeXrmEasy. This means: If your customer directs your work, your customer must buy the license. If you however are self-directed and introduce FakeXrmEasy into a software that will be used by your customer, you must buy the license.

**Does the Commercial license include support?**

Yes, anyone who purchases a Commercial license is entitled to support.

**Can I use FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later without a commercial license internally within a commercial company?**

No, all usage within an commercial company or for a commercial purpose that doesn't meet the requirements of the RPL 1.5 nor the Modified Polyform Non-commercial license 1.0.0, requires a commercial license.

**Do I still need the licenses when my project is done?**

When your project is complete, you only need licenses for the developers who maintain the code. If your project has been deprecated and is no longer being maintained; you can cancel your subscription.

**Are you applying the license change retroactively?**

No, these license changes apply to FakeXrmEasy software version 2 or later. You can stay in version 1.x, if you wish. However, you won't be able to use any code from version 2 or later in your 1.x fork as it is legally under a different license.
