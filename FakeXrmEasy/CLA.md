**How to use this CLA**

If You are an employee and have created the Contribution as part of your employment, You need to have Your employer approve this Agreement.

By accepting this Agreement, you warrant to Us that you are the owner of the work and that you have obtained all necessary authorizations to be bound by this Agreement. 

In any event, please contact Us at info@dynamicsvalue.com

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the copyrights covering the Contribution to use the Contribution in any manner, including, but not limited to:

**2.2.	Patent license**

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of Materials distributed by Us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable (except as stated in Section 3.2) patent license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with any Material (and portions of such combination). This license applies to all patents owned or controlled by You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring of Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with any Material.

**2.3.	Revocation of patent license**

You reserve the right to revoke the patent license stated in section 2.3 if We make any infringement claim that is targeted at your Contribution and not asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims of the Patents shall be considered for a "Defensive Purpose" if the claims are asserted against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Us or any of Our licensees.

**3.	Copyright license back to You**

Upon such grant of rights to Us, where Your Contribution proves to be substantial in terms of investment in time, effort and/or utility, You may be granted from Us, at Our sole discretion,  a worldwide, royalty-free, paid-up, revocable, non-exclusive, license to use the FAKEXRMEASY (version 2 or later) in  accordance with the FAKEXRMEASY (version 2 or later) SOFTWARE LICENSE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT (current version in Annex 1), disregarding Section 2.2.(ii) thereof ("Subscription fee / Credential Use Restriction") and Section 4 ("Fees, payment and taxes"), which shall not apply to You.

**4.	Moral rights**

Moral Rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognized and not waivable by applicable law. Notwithstanding, You may add your name to the attribution mechanism customary used in the Materials you Contribute to, such as the header of the source code files of Your Contribution, and We will respect this attribution when using Your Contribution.

**5.	Disclaimer**

THE CONTRIBUTION AND THE FAKEXRMEASY (version 2 or later) ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION AND EXTENT TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD AND EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

**6.	Consequential damage waiver**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

**7.	Approximation of disclaimer and damage waiver**

IF THE DISCLAIMER AND DAMAGE WAIVER MENTIONED IN SECTION 5. AND SECTION 6. CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW, REVIEWING COURTS SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAW THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL CIVIL OR CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.

**8.	Term**

8.2.	This Agreement shall apply for the term of the copyright and patents licensed here.

8.3.	In the event of a termination of this Agreement Sections 5. through 9 (inclusive) shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter.

9.1.	This Agreement and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings arising out of this agreement or relating in any way to it shall be governed by the laws of Barcelona, Spain excluding its private international law provisions.

9.3.	If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

9.4.	You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.
