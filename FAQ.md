License FAQ
=====================================

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding our licenses.


**Why have you changed the license?**

Short answer: sustainability. The demands of users of FakeXrmEasy has grown well over capacity and it can't be managed as a community side-project anymore. Therefore, we're changing the license so that we can continue to deliver always up-to-date amazing software for businesses while also making it free of charge for true community projects and/or non-commercial purposes. [For the full long answer about how we got here, please read this post.](https://dynamicsvalue.com/v2/why) 

**What license does FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later use?**

FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later uses a triple licensed model. You can choose to use the software under the OSI approved Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL 1.5), a Modified Polyform Non-commercial 1.0.0 license, or a commercial license. [See the license for more details](http://link-to-license).

**Can I use the new version free of charge?**

You can use FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later according to the requirements of the [RPL 1.5](http://link-to-RPL) or the [Modified Polyform Non-commercial license](http://link-to-modified-polyform). 

**Can I use FakeXrmEasy version 2 or later for my personal project?**

Yes, both RPL 1.5 and the Modified Polyform Non-commercial licenses cover personal use.

**What does a 'user' mean?**

A user means a person who is directly using FakeXrmEasy software version 2 or later. Licenses are granted per person and can not be shared. As a rule of thumb - anyone that writes or needs to debug code that uses FakeXrmEasy should be covered by a commercial license.

If you offer FakeXrmEasy as a service internally, (for example by exposing its functionality via an API), your company must subscribe for a subscription covering the number of internal users (developers) of that service since these are also your users. 

If you offer your own framework or extensions on top of FakeXrmEasy, users of such framework or extensions will also need a valid license.

**Do I need to pay for additional seats for my build or release pipelines / agents?**

No. The license covers unlimited build agents or release pipelines as long as every developer who is pushing changes though these pipelines has a valid FakeXrmEasy license.

**Are you applying the license change retroactively?**

No, these license changes apply to FakeXrmEasy software version 2 or later. You can stay in version 1.x, if you wish. However, you won't be able to use any code in version 2 or later in your fork as it is under a different license.
